              Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a
              diameter of just 3,031 miles (4,880 kilometers). It is the closest
              planet to the Sun, with an average distance of about 36 million
              miles (58 million kilometers). Because of its proximity to the
              Sun, temperatures on Mercury can reach up to 800 degrees
              Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) during the day, and drop to -290
              degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) at night.

              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition. It is the hottest planet in our solar system with a thick and toxic atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide. Venus rotates very slowly, taking 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation, but its orbit around the Sun only takes 225 Earth days.
